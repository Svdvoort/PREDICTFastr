def get_log_features(image, mask, parameters=dict()):
    '''
    Compute features by filtering an image with a Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)
    filter, after which histogram features are extracted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image: numpy array, mandatory
            Image array from which the features are extracted.

    mask: numpy array, mandatory
            ROI to be used for feature extraction.

    parameters: dictionary, optional
            Contains the parameters for feature computation. Currently can only
            include a list of sigma values to be used for the LoG filter.
            Default values for sigma are [1, 5, 10].

    Returns
    ----------
    LoG_features: list
            Contains the values for all extracted features.

    LoG_labels: list
            Contains the labels for all extracted features. Each entry
            corresponds to the element with the same index from the
            LoG_features object.
