        ======
        A new XNAT client that exposes XNAT objects/functions as python
        objects/functions.
        
        Disclaimer
        ----------
        
        This is NOT pyxnat, but a new module which is not as mature but uses a
        different philisophy for the user interface. Pyxnat is located at:
        `https://pythonhosted.org/pyxnat/ <https://pythonhosted.org/pyxnat/>`_
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        To install just use the setup.py normally::
        
          python setup.py install
        
        or install directly using pip::
        
          pip install xnat
        
        To get started, create a connection and start querying::
        
          >>> import xnat
          >>> session = xnat.connect('https://central.xnat.org', user="", password="")
          >>> session.projects['Sample_DICOM'].subjects
        
        when using IPython most functionality can be figured out by looking at the
        available attributes/methods of the returned objects.
        
        Credentials
        -----------
        
        To store credentials this module uses the .netrc file. This file contains login
        information and should be accessible ONLY by the user (if not, the module with
        throw an error to let you know the file is unsafe).
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The official documentation can be found at `xnat.readthedocs.org <http://xnat.readthedocs.org>`_
        This documentation is a stub, but shows the classes and methods available.
        
        Status
        ------
        
        Currently we do not support the creation of Projects, Subjects, Experiments, etc
        via code. You can create resources and uploads files to them. Also it is
        possible to import data via the import service (upload a zip file). There is
        also some support for working with the prearchive (reading, moving, deleting and
        archiving).
        
        There is virtuall no documentation or testing, this is a known limitation.
