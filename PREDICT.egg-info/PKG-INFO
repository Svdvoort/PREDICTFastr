Description: PREDICT v2.1.1
        ==============
        
        PREDICT: a Radiomics Extensive Digital Interchangable Classification Toolkit
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        This is an open-source python package supporting Radiomics medical image
        feature extraction and classification.
        
        We aim to add a wide variety of features and classifiers to address a
        wide variety classification problems. Through a modular setup, these can
        easily be interchanged and compared.
        
        Documentation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        For more information, see the sphinx generated documentation available
        `here (WIP) <http://predict.readthedocs.io/>`__.
        
        Alternatively, you can generate the documentation by checking out the
        master branch and running from the root directory:
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py build_sphinx
        
        The documentation can then be viewed in a browser by opening
        ``PACKAGE_ROOT\build\sphinx\html\index.html``.
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        PREDICT has currently only been tested on Unix with Python 2.7.6 and
        higher. We plan to merge towards Python 3 early 2019.
        
        The package can be installed through pip :
        
        ::
        
            pip install PREDICT
        
        Alternatively, you can use the provided setup.py file:
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Make sure you first install the required packages:
        
        ::
        
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        Preprocessing
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        From version 1.0.2 and on, preprocessing has been removed from PREDICT.
        It is now available as a separate tool in the `WORC
        package <https://github.com/MStarmans91/WORC>`__, as it's also a
        separate step in the radiomics workflow. We do advice to use the
        preprocessing function and thus also WORC.
        
        3rd-party packages used in PREDICT:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        We mainly rely on the following packages:
        
        -  SimpleITK (Image loading and preprocessing)
        -  numpy (Feature computation)
        -  sklearn, scipy (Classification)
        -  FASTR (Fast and parallel workflow execution)
        -  pandas (Storage)
        -  PyRadiomics
        
        See also the `requirements file <requirements.txt>`__.
