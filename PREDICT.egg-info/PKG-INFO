        ===============
        
        PREDICT: a Radiomics Extensive Digital Interchangable Classification Toolkit
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        This is an open-source python package supporting radiomics image feature
        extraction.
        
        Documentation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        For more information, see the sphinx generated documentation available
        in the docs folder. PREDICT is mostly used through `the WORC
        toolbox <https://github.com/MStarmans91/WORC>`__, in which further
        documentation on the features computed is also available, see
        https://worc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/static/features.html.
        
        Alternatively, you can generate the documentation by checking out the
        master branch and running from the root directory:
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py build_sphinx
        
        The documentation can then be viewed in a browser by opening
        ``PACKAGE_ROOT\build\sphinx\html\index.html``.
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        PREDICT has currently been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04, and Windows
        10 using Python 3.6.6 and higher.
        
        The package can be installed through pip :
        
        ::
        
            pip install PREDICT
        
        Alternatively, you can use the provided setup.py file:
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Make sure you first install the required packages:
        
        ::
        
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        Configuration and usage
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        We recommend using PREDICT through `the WORC
        toolbox <https://github.com/MStarmans91/WORC>`__, as WORC provides easy
        execution, good default configurations, and additional functionality
        such as preprocessing. If you want to use PREDICT as standalone package,
        we have included the default config for PREDICT from WORC in the
        ``tests`` folder. The main function of PREDICT is the
        ``PREDICT.CalcFeatures.CalcFeatures`` function, see tests.py in the test
        folder on the usage.
        
        3rd-party packages used in PREDICT:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        We mainly rely on the following packages:
        
        -  SimpleITK (Image loading and preprocessing)
        -  numpy (Feature computation)
        -  scikit-image
        -  pandas (Storage)
        -  PyRadiomics
        -  pydicom
        
        See also the `requirements file <requirements.txt>`__.
